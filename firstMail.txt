Hi Ana,

looking forward to meet you tomorrow. Unfortunately I just caught a nice cold
from my weekend trip to the lake district last saturday and sunday but that
shouldn't be a big problem to do the recording excercise.

A short introduction about myself:
My name is Lennart Wissel, I am studying Physics in Hannover and currently
doing an Erasmus year in Birmingham. Next year I am planning to
celebrate my 25th birthday here in the UK where I have never been prior to this
exchange. Having had an awesome indian summer during the first weeks the English
weather now finally convinced me to buy weatherproof clothes - it is quite
suprising how wet one can get by bicycling 5 minutes ;).

In general I'm easy to get along with, I like to get out of the city and
explore the countryside. So far I've been hiking in Wales, the lake district
and was visiting Oxford, Stonehenge, Bath and some minor castles in the
surroundings.

When I was not on the road we enjoyed cooking with other international
students or did a bit of sightseeing in Birmingham. There are a few pubs to
test out in the area ;).

Besides I'm playing Badminton in the competetive university squad what is
something I couldn't practive a lot in Germany over the last two years due to
nasty injuries.

Alright, this should be enough text :).

All the best,
Lennart
